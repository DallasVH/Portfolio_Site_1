        <h1>Summary</h1>    
        <p>Twisted Daylight is a horror game that takes place in the woods with a main cast of thrill seeking kids that want todiscover the truth behind a monster that has been rummered to be real. You play as one of thesekids or the monster. You quickly find out that they bit off more than they could chew.</p>
        <h2>Goal of the game</h2>
        <p>As one of the kids, your goal is to destroy all three effigies keeping the monster alive, then pass through the escape point before the monster kills you with its last breath! In order to do this you need to work with your teammate to destract the monster form each other in order to reash different effigies. Unfortunitly the player learns very quickly that it isn't as simple as that, cause as an effigie is destroyed, the monster will recieve a new ability based on the destroyed effigy.</p>
        <h1>My Contributions</h1>    
        <p>I was the lead level designer for this game which did pose some difficulty as the semester went on. I had to learn how to adapt a map based on the number of players our team decided to go with. Originally we were going to have four different player characters that the player could choose from playing as. Unfortunitly as the semester went on we had to adjust that number and ended up finalizing with two. This makes a big difference when determining the map size, and positioning of goals around the map. For example, if there are two players in order for the players to beat the NPC, the effigies would need to located closer together than if there were four. I also contributed a lot of time to coding in Unreal Blueprint. I was able to learn more about the coding language and was able to susscfully transfer character animations, code effigies, and code the player interactions, such as a stamina system.</p>
