        <h1>MY 2D Art Experience</h1>    
        <h2>Perspective</h2>
        <p>I have been able to practice with different kinds of perspective throughout my studies at Texas A&M. I  have been able to practice one point through five point perspective drawings and it has really helped me with drawing scenes and imagining things from different point of views.</p>
        <h2>Proportion</h2>
        <p>I was able to take the oportunity at A&M to take a life drawing class. This has taught me all about proportion and helped me specialize in human proportins. Knowing how to accuratly layout a person's body composure, with useful tips and tricks has helped me tremendously with character creation and concept art.</p>
        <h2>Medium</h2>
        <p>One thig I have had to get used to at A&M is that they make you usae a lot of varying mediums. I have been able to use pastels, colored pencils, charcoal, ink, markers, paint, even cutting paper. This has helped me to not only become profiecnet in these mediums but also become easily adjustabe to haveing to use something I am not entirely used to.</p>

        <h1>My 3D Art Experience</h1>
        <h2>Expression</h2>
        <p>Expression is always an important thing to highlight in works, but going about applying it in 3D art is a new ball game. All sides of the work need to successfully convey what you are trying to express and this is a skill I was able to learn at A&M. This helps me with 3D modeling and composition when setting up level designs.</p> 
        <h2>Exploitation</h2>
        <p>Taking advantage of your space as a 3D artist is extremely important. Negative space goes miles and will help things stand out that wouldn't have if the space was ignored. Creating this space takes a lot of practice and has really helped with my level design.</p>
        <h2>Clay</h2>
        <p>I have been able to work on clay and even build a lifesized bust of a face out of it. This hands on work has really helped me with my modeling skills becaus eit has helped me see the work in person instead of through a screen.</p>
